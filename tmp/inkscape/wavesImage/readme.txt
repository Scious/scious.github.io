The folders here contain files for the wave imagery in svg and png (for whichever turns out to be easier/better to use). 

The files correspond to a different layer in the composite image where file prefix 01 (or Image-01) corresponds to the foreground layer and 13 (or Image-13) corresponds to the background layer. The background layer in either format is a png file.

When animating the wave layers, layer 04 and 12 (corresponding to the seaMist) should move independently of the waves OR not at all so as to emulate how an ocean would behave.

If it is too difficult to animate the various waves independently using either svg or png, then just use the static image asset contained in this directory.
